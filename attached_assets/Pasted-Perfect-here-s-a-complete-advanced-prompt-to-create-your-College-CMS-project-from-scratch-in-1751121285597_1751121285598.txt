## 🧠 MASTER DEVELOPMENT PROMPT: Advanced College CMS From Scratch

> **Goal**: Build a full-featured, scalable, clean, and extensible CMS for managing **faculty workload, subject delegation, timetable management, and Excel data integration**.

### ⚙️ Stack Suggestion:

* **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS or Next.js + ShadCN
* **Backend**: Django REST Framework / Flask with SQLAlchemy
* **Database**: PostgreSQL or MySQL (dynamic schema support)
* **Excel Parser**: pandas + openpyxl (Python)
* **Auth**: JWT / Session + Role-Based Access (Admin, Faculty, Student)

---

## 🚀 CORE MODULES

### 🔑 1. AUTH & ROLES

* User registration + login
* Roles: `Admin`, `Faculty`, `Student`
* Dashboard layout changes per role

---

### 🏛️ 2. FACULTY MANAGEMENT

* Add/Edit/Delete faculty
* Assign designation: `Assistant Prof.`, `Associate Prof.`, `Professor`
* Set workload limits:

  * Assistant Prof: 18 hrs
  * Associate Prof: 16 hrs
  * Professor: 14 hrs
* View per-faculty workload:

  * Assigned lectures/tutorials/practicals
  * Completed vs pending work

---

### 📘 3. SUBJECTS MODULE

* Add subjects with:

  * Name, Code, Lecture Hours, Tutorial Hours, Practical Hours
  * Type: `Regular` or `Elective`
  * Semester, Department, Division
* Display with filters: semester, department, type

---

### 🧾 4. EXCEL IMPORT & COLUMN MAPPING

* Upload Excel file (XLSX or CSV)
* Show preview (first 10 rows)
* Auto-detect headers and allow **column-to-field mapping**

  * Example:

    ```
    "Faculty Name" → faculty_name
    "Lecture Hours" → lecture_hours
    ```
* Create new DB columns dynamically if not present
* Save mapping template
* Show import result (added/updated/skipped rows)
* Display imported data in a separate page with filter/search/export

---

### 🧑‍🏫 5. TASK/WORKLOAD ASSIGNMENT

* Assign subjects (lecture/tutorial/practical) to faculty
* Calculate workload in real-time
* Check if workload limit exceeded before assigning
* Search subjects by name/code/type
* Filter by semester/department/elective
* View faculty load chart: bar or pie view

---

### 📅 6. TIMETABLE MANAGEMENT

* Create and manage timetables per **division/semester**
* Assign subjects to slots:

  * Subject, Faculty, Room, Day, Time Slot
* Drag-and-drop interface (optional)
* Conflict detection (faculty double-booked, room clash)
* Export as PDF or image
* Separate timetable views:

  * Admin → full timetable
  * Faculty → only assigned lectures
  * Student → by division

---

### 📂 7. ADVANCED VIEWS & DASHBOARDS

* 📊 Dashboard (cards, charts):

  * Total faculty, lectures assigned, workload used, pending
* 🧠 Analytics:

  * Most loaded departments/faculty
  * Elective vs Regular subject ratio
* 🔎 Global Search:

  * Search across subject, faculty, division, semester
